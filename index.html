        <p>At ASAP, we offer potential students the opportunity to study abroad in their chosen country. We train them to prepare to study overseas, help them find the right place, assist them in filling in application forms, including writing up a statement of purpose (SOP) and help them through the visa processing and travel arrangements to reach their destination. In some cases, we may offer temporary housing and local hospitality so they can concentrate on their studies during the first few months. A help center is always ready to help them whenever needed.</p>

        <h2>Pre-application: </h2>
        <p>Preparation to apply for study abroad: During this phase, we assess the student's potentiality, interests, and expectations. Based on the evaluation, we create a profile of the student to suggest a few options for them. Based on the final choice of the student, we offer a preliminary plan for the student. The preparatory program will include the preparation for IELTS, refreshing basic knowledge on the subject they are planning to study, etc. The duration of the program may be three to six months, depending on the student's needs. If you want to know details about this service, please get in touch with us by filling in the form.</p>
